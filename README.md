ClojureScript TODO app
======================

Everybody needs another TODO app!

This is my playground for getting started with ClojureScript.

Development
-----------

You'll need to have the following tools installed:

- leiningen
- rlwrap

To code:

1. Start the magic live coding server

    ```
    $ bin/serve
    ```

1. Open your browser to http://localhost:3449/ to play with the app
1. Open your browser to http://localhost:3449/test.html to run the tests

When you make changes (save in your editor), you code will automatically be
reloaded and the tests will be run.
